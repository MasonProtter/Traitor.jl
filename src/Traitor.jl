"""
The `Traitor` package aims to bring a prototype of traits-based dispatch to
Julia. Users will primarily interact with `Traitor` via the `@traitor` macro.

Traits in `Traitor` follow a simple pattern. Firstly, all traits and groupings
of traits are types, and the traits corresponding to a Julia object can be
determined from its type alone. A "class" of traits is defined by an abstract
type, for example `abstract Size`. Examples of each trait are described by its
subtypes, for example `immutable Big <: Size; end` and
`immutable Small <: Size; end`.

Traits can be grouped in a couple of ways. Traits from the *same* class can be
combined in a `Union`, for example `Union{Big, Small}`. This union represents a
*larger* set of Julia objects than either `Big` or `Small` - they represent all
objects possessing either trait.

Conversely, traits from *different* classes can be combined in a `Tuple`, for
example `Tuple{Big, Smelly}` (where `Smelly <: Odor` is another trait from
the `Odor` class). These combinations represent a *smaller* set of Julia objects
than either `Big` or `Smelly` - they represent only objects that possess both
traits simultaneously.

To tell Julia that a type has a certain trait, you overload the constructor of
the trait class (the abstract supertype, e.g. `Size`). For example, we might
have `Size(::Type{Int}) = Small` and `Size{::Type{BigInt}} == Big`. Note that
types are used as both inputs and outputs. A default trait for all objects
can be given, e.g. `Size(::Any) = UnknownSize` (where `UnknownSize <: Size`).

Trait-based methods are created with the `@traitor` macro. Traits are defined
with an extra (optional) set of `::` in the function signature. For example:

    @traitor howbig(::Integer::Big) = "Huge!"
    @traitor howbig(::Integer::Union{Medium, Small}) = "Smallish"
    @traitor howbig(::Integer::Tuple{Big,Smelly}) = "That integer is really big and quite smelly"
    @traitor howbig(::Integer) = "Dunno"

The function is then called in the standard way, and `Traitor` will automatically
manage dispatch. If your code is statically typed, then this will be done at
compile time with no run-time overhead. For example:

    julia> howbig(1)
    "Smallish"

    julia> howbig(BigInt(1))
    "Huge!"

Finally, it is important to note that trait-dispatch occurs after standard
Julia multiple-dispatch. A function may contain many methods, of which
none, some or all will be split into trait-based submethods. The `@traitor`
macro will automatically take ownership of a single method, overwriting any
previous definition.

    @betray f

The goal of the `@betray` macro is to take over the methods of `f` and ready
them to be compatible with traits-based dispatch, so that new submethods
defined by `@traitor` do not overwrite existing default methods (and used where
no more specific trait match is found).

WARNING: Please note this macro has NOT been implemented yet! (If anyone knows
how to turn a `Method` object into a new method definition, please let us know).

However, methods of `f` with signatures other than `f(::T1, ::T2, ...)` remain
unaffected.

Dispatch on traits occurs after normal Julian multiple-dispatch for further
specialization to sub-methods. The most specific matching trait-signature is
chosen, or an error is thrown in the case of ambiguities.
